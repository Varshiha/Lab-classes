Authors: David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

It is discussed in chapter 1.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate object interaction and to examine
some simple code. See chapters one and three of the book.

To use this project, create some Student objects, then create a LabClass object.
Add the students to the class using the "enrolStudent" method. Print a class
list.

QUESTIONS FOR PART 5:
22. Everytime I press on getName it returns the name that I gave of that one specific object. For example, student1 returned the name Tom Smith, but student2 returned the name Joey Tribiani. These are the names that I had written under instance when I created the objects. 
24. When I created the object of type Lab-class, I put 2 as the maximum number, but when i called the numberOfStudents, it returned 0.
Question 31:
- 0 is int
- "hello" is String (quotation marks)
- 101 is int
- -1 is int
- true is boolean
- "33" is String (quotation marks)
- 3.1415 is double (decimal)

35. In the question, it says to look at the book YOU are reading now. So, if it is the book that I am reading right now which is the physical copy that I have in front of me as of right now it will be an object because it is MY book and its class would be Book in general and other objects would be other individual books that are around the world.

36. No, an object cannot have several classes. In fact, a class can have several object. Each object is specific but they come from the same category/blueprint. For example, one object can be student 1 named Tom Smith and another object called student 2 named Joey Tribiani and both of them are part of the class called Student.
