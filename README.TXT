It is discussed in chapter 1.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate object interaction and to examine
some simple code. See chapters one and three of the book.

To use this project, create some Student objects, then create a LabClass object.
Add the students to the class using the "enrolStudent" method. Print a class
list.

QUESTIONS FOR PART 5:
22. Everytime I press on getName it returns the name that I gave of that one specific object. For example, student1 returned the name Tom Smith, but student2 returned the name Joey Tribiani. These are the names that I had written under instance when I created the objects. 
24. When I created the object of type Lab-class, I put 2 as the maximum number, but when i called the numberOfStudents, it returned 0.
Question 31:
- 0 is int
- "hello" is String (quotation marks)
- 101 is int
- -1 is int
- true is boolean
- "33" is String (quotation marks)
- 3.1415 is double (decimal)
